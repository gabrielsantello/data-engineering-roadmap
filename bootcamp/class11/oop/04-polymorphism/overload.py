## In Python, method overloading is not directly supported as in some other programming languages,
## but you can simulate overloading using default parameters or variable arguments.

class Calculator:
    def sum(self, *args):
        total = 0
        for num in args:
            total += num
        return total

# Example usage
calculator = Calculator()
print(calculator.sum(1, 2))        # Output: 3
print(calculator.sum(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10
print(calculator.sum(5, 10, 15))   # Output: 30
