## Introduction
Welcome to our Python project focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! In this README, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of OOP and how they apply to Python.

## Understanding OOP Concepts
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **Classes** and **Objects**. Let's break down these terms:

- **Classes**: These are user-defined data types that act as blueprints or templates for creating objects. Think of classes as cake molds, and objects as the actual cakes baked from those molds.

- **Objects**: Objects are instances of a class. They can represent real-world entities (e.g., Car, Person, User) or abstract concepts (e.g., Temperature, Humidity, Measurement). Objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

- **Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of an object. They allow us to interact with and manipulate object data.

- **Attributes**: Attributes (also known as fields or properties) are the data associated with an object. They define the state of an object.

## Basic Principles of OOP
Here are the key principles you should master:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) together within a class. It helps keep related functionality organized and prevents external interference.

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and hierarchy.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated uniformly. It allows method calls to behave differently based on the object type. Think of it as "many forms."

## Getting Started with Python OOP
To dive into Python OOP, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**: Start by cloning this project to your local machine.

2. **Explore the `src/` directory**: Inside the `src/` directory, you'll find Python files related to various OOP topics.

3. **Learn from examples**: Study the code samples provided. Each file demonstrates a specific aspect of OOP.

4. **Experiment**: Modify the code, create your own classes, and play with objects. Observe how inheritance and polymorphism work.

5. **Refer to relevant sections**: Whenever you need explanations, refer back to this README for detailed information.

Happy coding! üêçüöÄ.
