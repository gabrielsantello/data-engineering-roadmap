# Python Project Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up a Python project. Follow these steps to get started:

## 1. Cloning the Project Repository

To clone the project repository using Git, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your project repository.

## 2. Running the Code

To run the code, you'll need the following tools installed:

1. **Pyenv-win**: Install Pyenv-win using pip (for Windows):
   ```
   pip install pyenv-win
   ```

2. **Poetry**: Install Poetry (Python package manager) using pip:
   ```
   pip install poetry
   ```

3. **VSCode**: Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website.

## 3. Installing Dependencies

After cloning the repository and setting up Pyenv-win, Poetry, and VSCode, follow these steps to install project dependencies:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment using Poetry:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

This will install all the required dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

## Conclusion

You're now ready to start working on your Python project! Refer to the project documentation for further details on how to run and develop your code.
