# Python Code Formatting and Style Guide

## Introduction
This README provides guidelines for maintaining clean and consistent Python code. Following these best practices ensures readability, maintainability, and adherence to the PEP 8 style guide. We'll cover the following tools:

1. **PEP 8**: The official Python Enhancement Proposal that defines the coding conventions for the Python standard library.
2. **Black**: An uncompromising code formatter that automatically formats your Python code to follow PEP 8 guidelines.
3. **isort**: A tool for sorting Python imports in a consistent and organized manner.
4. **flake8**: A code linting tool that checks your code against PEP 8 and identifies potential issues.
5. **Pre-commit Hooks**: A mechanism to run checks automatically before each commit.
