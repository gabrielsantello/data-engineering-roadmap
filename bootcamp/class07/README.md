# Python Functions and Data Structures Guide

This README provides an overview of essential concepts related to Python functions and data structures. We'll cover the following topics:

1. **Functions in Python**: Learn about defining and using functions, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
2. **Data Structures**: Explore different data structures available in Python, such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. These structures allow you to organize and manipulate data efficiently.

## 1. Functions in Python
- **Functions**: In Python, functions are named blocks of code that can be called with specific arguments. They allow you to encapsulate logic, improve code readability, and promote code reusability.

Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    """Print a personalized greeting."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```

## 2. Common Data Structures
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items. Lists can hold elements of different data types and are mutable (modifiable).

Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[0])  # Access the first element
fruits.append("grape")  # Add a new fruit
```

- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs where keys are unique. Useful for mapping data.

Example:
```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])  # Access value by key
person["city"] = "New York"  # Add a new key-value pair
```

- **Tuples**: Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation).

Example:
```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # Access the first value
```

- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements. Useful for removing duplicates.

Example:
```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
colors.add("yellow")  # Add a new color
```

Happy coding! üöÄüêç
