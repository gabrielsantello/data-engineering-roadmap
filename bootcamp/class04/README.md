# Python Basics: Type Hints, Complex Types, File Reading, and Functions

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of essential Python concepts related to type hints, complex data types (such as dictionaries, DataFrames, tables, and Excel), file reading (including the `with` statement), and functions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable Python code.

## 1. Type Hints
Type hints allow you to annotate function parameters and return values with their expected data types. Although Python is dynamically typed, type hints improve code readability and help catch potential errors early.

Example:
```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## 2. Complex Data Types
### - Dictionaries
Dictionaries are key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key. They are useful for organizing and retrieving data efficiently.

### - DataFrames (Pandas)
DataFrames are two-dimensional, tabular data structures provided by the Pandas library. They resemble tables and allow data manipulation and analysis.

### - Tables (SQL)
Tables are structured data representations used in SQL databases. They store data in rows and columns, making them suitable for querying and joining data.

### - Excel Spreadsheets
Python can read and write data from Excel spreadsheets using libraries like Pandas or openpyxl.

## 3. File Reading (including the `with` statement)
Python provides various methods to read data from files, such as `open()`, `read()`, and `readlines()`. The `with` statement ensures proper resource management and automatically closes the file when done.

Example:
```python
with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

## 4. Functions (including 3 examples)
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They improve code organization and maintainability.

### Example 1: Adding Two Numbers
```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(f"Sum: {result}")
```

### Example 2: Greeting Function
```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
print(greet("Bob"))
```

### Example 3: Checking Even or Odd
```python
def check_even_odd(number: int) -> str:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

print(check_even_odd(7))
print(check_even_odd(12))
```
