# Python Basics: Debugging, Control Structures, Lists, and Dictionaries

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of essential Python concepts related to debugging, control structures (such as `if`, `for`, and `while`), lists, and dictionaries. Additionally, we'll briefly discuss workflow tools like Databricks and Apache Airflow.

## 1. Debugging
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in your code. Common techniques include using print statements, breakpoints, and debugging tools. Always test your code thoroughly to catch any issues early.

## 2. Control Structures
### - `if` Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute specific code blocks based on conditions. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control program flow.

### - `for` Loops
`for` loops iterate over a sequence (such as a list or range) and execute a block of code for each item.

### - `while` Loops
`while` loops repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.

## 3. Lists
A list is a collection of items, ordered and mutable. You can store different data types in a list and perform various operations on it.

## 4. Dictionaries
Dictionaries are key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key. They allow efficient data retrieval based on keys.

## 5. Workflow Tools
### - Databricks
[Databricks](https://databricks.com/) is a cloud-based platform for big data analytics and machine learning. It provides collaborative notebooks, data processing, and visualization tools.

### - Apache Airflow
[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is an open-source workflow automation tool. It allows you to define, schedule, and monitor complex workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
